# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction App

An AI-powered machine learning web app that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

## 🧠 Purpose
This project demonstrates the application of AI in healthcare by predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a Random Forest classifier trained on real-world medical data.

## 🔍 Features
- Interactive web app built with Streamlit
- Real-time prediction based on user input
- Trained with Random Forest model using scikit-learn
- Data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding handled in Python
- Hosted live on Streamlit Cloud

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## 📂 How It Works
1. The model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
2. Categorical values are encoded and numerical data is scaled.
3. User inputs are collected through a Streamlit UI.
4. The model returns a prediction indicating high or low risk.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Applied machine learning to a real-world healthcare problem
- Built and deployed an interactive AI web app
- Learned model deployment with Streamlit Cloud
- Practiced version control and code organization using Git/GitHub

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Display prediction probabilities
- Visualize data distributions and risk factors
- Add user authentication or history saving
